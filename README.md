# Perambulate

Perambulate is a physics-based, VR construction game inspired by sodaplay.

Use actuators to build machines and set them loose.

To try Perambulate, you need a [WebVR compatible browser](http://webvr.info/) and a Leap Motion
controller attached to your HMD.

Perambulate was developed in [Firefox Nightly](http://mozvr.com/) with an Oculus Rift DK2 but 
it should work with Chrome WebVR builds and with a DK1.

## Usage and Tips

Watch the video to get an idea of how Perambulate works: http://youtu.be/qLC8L-58Juk

Bend the middle and ring fingers on your left hand to display the control panels :metal:.

Be deliberate with your hand movements. The pose and grab detection isn't very intelligent.
